# Investigating Enrons scandal using Machine Learning
===================================================

## Introduction
> [In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal)

From a $90 price per share, to a $1 value represents the huge value loss and scam that happened in Enron. This has been
